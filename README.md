# Browser Extensions Manager UI

This is a **Vanilla JavaScript front-end project** I built to practice working with **JSON data**, **DOM manipulation**, and **responsive design**.  
It simulates a browser extensions manager where users can toggle themes, filter extensions, and manage their states — all powered by data from a `data.json` file.
